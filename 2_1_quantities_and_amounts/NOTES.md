## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
This took a lot longer than I hoped. There were more than a few trial and error moments
where i lost track of what changes were made and whether certain typos were always there and causing the problems
- What went easier than expected?
I can confidently say that nothing came easy this time. It was a grind but glad i was able to figure things out.

- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
