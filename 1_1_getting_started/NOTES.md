    (No blocks, but I used git bash to stage/commit/push the html and css files. I will try to use VS Code for NOTES.md)

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.
