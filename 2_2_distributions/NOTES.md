## NOTES

-----------
INSTRUCTIONS:
Use this markdown file to keep track of open questions/challenges from this week's assignment.
- What did you have trouble solving?
Finding a small enough data source
- What went easier than expected?
Using/modifying the code from class. There weren't any fundamental hiccups in applying the basic
steps to the new data.  
- What, if anything, is currently blocking you?
I'm not happy with the visuals. It's not very appealing and the dataset isn't the greatest.

Sometimes it helps to formulate what you understood and where you got stuck in order to move forward. Feel free to include `code snippets`, `screenshots`, and `error message text` here as well.

If you find you're not able complete this week's assignment, reflecting on where you are getting stuck here will help you get full credit for this week's tutorial
